\title{An \code{\link{R6}} \code{ParaMonteSampler} class for \link{paramonte} package usage}
\description{
This is the \code{ParaMonteSampler} base class for the ParaMonte sampler routines. This class is NOT meant to be directly accessed or
called by the user of the \link{paramonte} package. However, its children, such as the \code{\link{ParaDRAM}} sampler class will be directly
accessible to the public.
}
\section{Public fields}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="r6-fields">}}
\describe{
\item{\code{buildMode}}{optional string argument with the default value “release”. possible choices are:
\itemize{
\item “debug”

to be used for identifying sources of bug and causes of code crash.
\item “release”

to be used in all other normal scenarios for maximum runtime efficiency.
}}

\item{\code{mpiEnabled}}{Optional logical (boolean) indicator which is \code{FALSE} by default.

If it is set to \code{TRUE}, it will cause the ParaMonte simulation to run in parallel on the requested
number of processors.

See the class documentation guidelines in the above for information on how to run a simulation in
parallel.}

\item{\code{inputFile}}{Optional string input representing the path to an external input namelist of simulation specifications.

USE THIS OPTIONAL ARGUMENT WITH CAUTION AND ONLY IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
\subsection{WARNING:}{

Specifying an input file will cause the sampler to ignore all other simulation specifications set
by the user via sampler instance's \code{spec}-component attributes.
}}

\item{\code{spec}}{An R list containing all simulation specifications.

All simulation attributes are by default set to appropriate values at runtime. To override the
default simulation specifications, set the \code{spec} attributes to some desired values of your choice.

If you need help on any of the simulation specifications, try the supplied \code{helpme()} function in
this component.

If you wish to reset some specifications to the default values, simply set them to \code{NULL}.}

\item{\code{reportEnabled}}{optional logical (boolean) indicator which is \code{TRUE} by default.

If it is set to \code{TRUE}, it will cause extensive guidelines to be printed on the standard output
as the simulation or post-processing continues with hints on the next possible steps that could
be taken in the process. If you do not need such help and information set this variable to \code{FALSE}
to silence all output messages.}
